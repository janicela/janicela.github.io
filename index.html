             Hello! My name is Janice Lai and I am currently a freshman at University at Buffalo.
            I am from the city that never sleeps (but when the night falls, every restaurant in the
            city is closed), so Buffalo is a huge change for me. One thing that I love about home is
            the transportation. I never realized how much it effected my life because after coming
            to Buffalo, the only way to get places if you own a car. And if you don't
            you're pretty much stuck in the campus of University at Buffalo.
          </p>
              <p>
                Prior to coming to Buffalo, I have taken classes on Python. I am familiar
                with some of the language but not as good as I want it to be.
                I am currently studying Java at University at Buffalo and am hoping
                to familiarize myself with it.
              </p>

            <h2><center><u> Interests</u></center> </h2>
            <p1> One of the main things I like to do is to <b> explore</b>. I like to travel
              around the world to understand the cultures and traditions that are being taught.
            </p1>
              <p> Another interest that I recently started loving is watching movies
              at this family theater around my neighborhood. This theater isn't
              quite the same price as a normal theater. It's around $7 for a ticket,
              and other places (such as AMC) are around $14! Though, the quality of
              the food and the place isn't that great, it is still a good environment
              to be in! </p>

          <h1><center><u> Classes</u></center> </h1>
           <p3> I am taking all the basic classes that a freshman majoring in Computer Science would take.
             <ul> Math 141, Calculus </ul>
             <ul> CSE 115, Intro to Computer Science </ul>
             <ul> Eng 105, English </ul>
             <ul> CSE 199, Computer Science Seminar </ul>

             Some classes that I want to take in the future is psychology because reading people
             is really cool, if I get it right.
