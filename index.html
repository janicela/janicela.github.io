          <p>
             Hello! My name is Janice Lai and I am currently a freshman at University at Buffalo.
            I am from the city that never sleeps (but when the night falls, every restaurant in the
            city is closed), so it is a huge change for me. One thing that I love about home is
            the transportation. I never realized how much it effected my life because after coming
            to Buffalo, the only way to get places if you own a car.
          </p>
              <p>
                Prior to coming to Buffalo, I have taken classes on Python. I am familiar
                with some of the language but not as good as I want it to be.
                I am currently studying Java at University at Buffalo and am hoping
                to familiarize myself with it.
              </p>

            <h2><center><u> Interests</u></center> </h2>
            <p1> One of the main things I like to do is to <b> explore</b>. I like to travel
              around the world to understand the cultures and traditions that are being taught.
              Not only that, the scenery is beautiful.

          <h3><center><u> Classes</u></center> </h3>
           <p3> I am taking all the basic classes that a freshman majoring in Computer Science would take.
             <ul> Math 141, Calculus </ul>
             <ul> CSE 115, Intro to Computer Science </ul>
             <ul> Eng 105, English </ul>
             <ul> CSE 199, Computer Science Seminar </ul>

             Some classes that I want to take in the future is psychology because reading people
             is really cool, if I get it right.
