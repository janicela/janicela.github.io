             Hello! </p>
             <p> My name is Janice Lai and I am currently a freshman at University at Buffalo.
            I am from the city that never sleeps (which is quite confusing
            because when the night falls, every restaurant and store in the
            city is closed). One thing that I love about home is
            the transportation. Not only can I get from place to place using the MTA, but I can also
            see different types of people on the train. We have the eaters,
            showtime dancers, crazy minded and smelly people, and so much more! Everyday
            while taking the subway, there is always bound to be something new!

          </p>
              <p>
                Prior to coming to Buffalo, I have taken a beginner's Python(no, not the snake) at
                Hofstra University in Long Island.  I am familiar with some of the language but I am
                 not as good as I want to be.I am currently studying Java at University at Buffalo and
                 am hoping to familiarize myself with it.
              </p>

            <p> </p>
            <p1> One of the main things I like to do is to <b> explore</b>. I like to travel
              around the world to understand the cultures and traditions that are being taught.

            </p1>
              <p> Another interest that I recently started loving is watching movies
              at a family theater around my neighborhood. This theater isn't
              quite the same price as a normal theater. It's around $7 for a ticket,
              and other places (such as AMC) are around $14! Though, the quality of
              the food and the place isn't that great, it is still a good environment
              to be in! </p>

          <p> </p>
           <p3> I am taking all the basic classes that a freshman majoring in Computer Science would take.
             <ul> Math 141, Calculus </ul>
             <ul> CSE 115, Intro to Computer Science </ul>
             <ul> Eng 105, English </ul>
             <ul> CSE 199, Computer Science Seminar </ul>

             Some classes that I want to take in the future is psychology, and of course
             computer classes, because reading people
             is really cool, if I actually get it right.
