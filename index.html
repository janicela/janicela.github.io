      <h1> About </h1>
      <p> My name is Janice Lai and I am currently a freshman at University at Buffalo.
        I am studying Computer Science and prior to coming here, I had little
        knowledge of computer programming. I know a little of Python and I am currently studying
        the language of Java.
        <p>
      <h2> Interests</h2>
      <p1> One of the main things I like to do is to <b> explore</b>. I like to travel
        around the world to understand the cultures and traditions that are being taught.
        Not only that, the scenery is beautiful.
     </p1>
     <h3> Classes</h3>
     <p3> I am taking all the basic classes that a freshman majoring in Computer Science would take.
       <ul> Math 141, Calculus </ul>
       <ul> CSE 115, Intro to Computer Science </ul>
       <ul> Eng 105, English </ul>
       <ul> CSE 199, Computer Science Seminar </ul>

       Some classes that I want to take in the future is psychology because reading people
       is really cool, if I get it right.
